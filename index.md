## Intro
Hey there, I'm excited to welcome you to my blog where I share my passion for open source technologies on the IBM i operating system. As a developer and architect, I've seen firsthand the power of using open source tools and languages to support mission-critical applications and handle large amounts of data on IBM i. That's why I'm so excited to share how to articles, tips, and tricks with you. Through this blog, I hope to help you take your IBM i platform to the next level, reduce software costs, and collaborate with developers from around the world. So whether you're a business owner, seasoned IT pro, or just starting out, join me as we explore the world of open source on IBM i together.

## Who this Blog is For
This blog is for seasoned RPG / COBOL / CL / DB2 developers and architects, of course.  It will also be geared towards people who are curious about what the IBM i can do.  Perhaps there is one or more IBM Power servers running  IBM i in your organization and you would like to learn more about it, and perhaps like me you want to break down walls between IBM i folks and the rest of your shop.
