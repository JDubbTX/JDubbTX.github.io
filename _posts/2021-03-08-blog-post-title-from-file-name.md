## About Me

My name is John Weirich, and I am a developer and architect on the IBM i platform.  More recently I've branched into other technologies in the Devops space.  Most of my work history has been with a company called Nelnet, a student loan company based in Lincoln Nebraska, though they have offices in other locations such as Centennial Colorado, Madison Wisconsin, Boise Idaho, and Albany New York.  While I have visited all the previously mentioned office locations, on a day-to-day basis I work remotely from my home near College Station, Texas, and have done so for over 10 years. 
 
Nelnet has been an amazing company for me to learn and grow on the IBM i platform, as well as other technologies.   If you are looking for a job, whether it be as a customer service rep, or in the technology space, please check out Nelnet's careers page.  It’s a great company to work for.
 
My passion is for modernization and open source technologies on the IBM i platform.   Nelnet is a member of the IBM i LUG, or Large User Group.  Through attending LUG meetings, or other conferences like the now defunct RPG and DB2 summit, I have learned quite a bit about modernization of the IBM i platform
 
My other passions include adoption and foster care, as well as playing my cello.  At the time of this writing, I've been married to my wife Bekah for 25 years, and I am the father in a large family with 9 kids, almost all of whom are adopted, placed with us in foster care, or we have custody that stemmed from foster care.  My oldest daughter Madelyn is our only natural born progeny, and she is currently living and studying abroad in Madrid, Spain.  Lately I've been been playing my cello for The Theatre Company’s production of the broadway musical Oklahoma!.
